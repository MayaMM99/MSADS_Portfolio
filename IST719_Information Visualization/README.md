## Project

Attrition in business describes a gradual but deliberate reduction in staff numbers that occurs as employees retire or resign and are not replaced. The term is also sometimes used to describe the loss of customers or clients as they mature beyond a product or company's target market without being replaced by a younger generation. The key to success in any organization is attracting and retaining top talent.

The battle with attrition and its implications to productivity and morale is possibly the biggest headache that any manager will have to face. Responses to counteract and to decrease attrition often require the manager to understand the causes and estimate the costs associated with staff turnover.
