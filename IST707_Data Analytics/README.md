## Data Analytics

This course introduces data mining techniques, real-world applications of those techniques and their challenges. Students learn popular data mining methods to gain insight from data and solve complex issues across industries. Students also acquire hands-on experience using current software to develop data mining solutions to scientific and business problems. Topics include the key tasks of data mining. Through the exploration of the concepts and techniques of data mining and practical exercises, students will develop skills that can be applied to business, science or other organizational problems. Additionally, students will use R and other open source tools to perform machine learning across a range of situations when working with structured data (including clustering, classification, decision tree and association rules).

## Project 
The project is performed in RStudio. The Austin Animal Center is the largest no-kill animal shelter and shelters and protects over 18,000 animals each year. As part of the City of Austin’s Open Data Initiative, the Center makes available their data detailing shelter pet intake and outcomes. According to the data portal, over 90% of animal outcomes are adoptions, transfers to other shelter partners or returning lost pets to owners. The questions we want to answer are:

• Is there a predictable pattern or visible trend to shelter pet outcomes?

• What features are the best determinant for animal shelter outcomes?

• What features are the best determinant for whater or not the animal is adopted?

Dataset of intakes and outcomes from Austin Animal Shelter  is analyzed to discover and understand animal adoption trends, including which attributes of animals result in a higher likelihood of adoption. The final goal is to predict whether or not an animal will be adopted based on characteristics Austin Animal shelter can identify upon intake.
