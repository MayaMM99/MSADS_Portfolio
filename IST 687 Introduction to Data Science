# IST 687: Introduction to Data Science

The course provides students a hands-on introduction to data science, with applied examples of data collection, processing, transformation, management and analysis. Students will explore key concepts related to data science, including applied statistics, information visualization, text mining and machine learning. R, the open source statistical analysis and visualization system, will be used throughout the course. R is reckoned by many to be the most popular choice among data analysts worldwide; having knowledge and skill with using it is considered a valuable and marketable job skill for most data scientists. Students will also learn how to use supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. They will focus on structured data, using R (e.g., support vector machines, association rules mining) in conjunction with learning the full life cycle of data science.

## Project Description

This project, performed in RStudio, deals with a dataset containing aggregated information on US K-12 Education since 1992. This dataset is designed to bring together multiple facets of U.S. education data into one convenient CSV file format. Different versions of the dataset are available online at https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project, where one can find different databases. Given that we had multiple options on the ways we could look at US K-12 Education through different data sets, we decided to reshape and model our own data sets as reported in the fourth section here below. Our goal with this project is to understand if and how student enrollment and achievement in time correlates to revenue/expenditure ratio and the student demographic information about race and gender. In order to reach some actionable insight we decided to focus our attention in particular on three states: New York State, Massachusetts, and Florida. Why these three states? Our actionable insights will be directed toward New York States. Instead, we chose to compare New York State to Massachusetts and Florida for a simple reasons: they are the states with the highest and the lowest average scores in reading and math across the whole K-12 educational grade spectrum respectively.
